I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection: CSS definitly makes life more difficult but there is a lot of 
flexibility when using it. There are also a lot of neat effects such as 
shadow boxes and animations which show the power behind CSS. I think it can
be very frustrating trying to figure out what I want (which is a battle within
itself) and then translating that in such a way that it's not a bunch of 
broken css rules. I'm still trying to get comfortable and I feel like my
solution was not the most optamial (espically when the screen resizes) but
I'm mostly happy with how the site came out.

      <h2>Trapped Obligations</h2>

      <p>The following haiku is primarily a reflection during my research phase
      at facilities such as Los Alamos, Little Mountain, and Sandia.</p>

      <p class="poem-content">
        <i>Still dull area</i><br>
        <i>Potential fleeting cycles</i><br>
        <i>Time ticks forward more</i><br>
      </p>

      <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>

      <p>I generally enjoy learning and messing around with electronics. A couple
      activities include creating HDL for FPGA via System Verilog, learning about
      Linux through Arch as well as embedded SoC devices, electronic repair and
      modifications, homebrewing video game consoles, and circuit design.
      Currently, I'm trying to use electronics to demonstrate principles from
      physics.</p>

      <p>I enjoy playing a variety of video games. I generally play older games
      from the Xbox 360, wii, Playstation 2, Nintetndo 64, and Super Nintendo. A 
      couple of my favorite games are Fallout New Vegas, Sly Cooper Series, 
      Burnout 3, 007 Nightfire, Mario Kart Wii, Super Mario 64, Donkey Kong 64,
      and Super Mario World. I also really enjoy playing rhythm games such as
      Dance Dance Revolution and Beat Saber.</p>

      <p>I like designing 3D models and understanding how to print them.
      I use both a Prusa MK4S and a Bamboo X1 Carbon depending on the project.
      Currently, I'm printing cabinets or "cubbies" to hold and organize my 
      small electronic components. I've also printed a camera mount to mount
      my remote camera to my guinea pig cage and a keychain of the Wasatch
      Ranger while I was the computer teacher at Wasatch Elementary.</p>
